# 📝 Small Note Manager

A simple and lightweight note management system built with **Spring Boot**. Perfect for learning Spring Boot fundamentals while creating a functional app to manage notes. This was my first dive into Spring Boot, and it was quite a journey! 😄

## ✨ Features
- **Admin Dashboard**: View all notes in the system at `/admin/notes/showall`.
- Create, read, and manage notes with a RESTful API.
- Simple and beginner-friendly codebase.
- (Add more features here if you have them, e.g., user authentication, note categories, etc.)
